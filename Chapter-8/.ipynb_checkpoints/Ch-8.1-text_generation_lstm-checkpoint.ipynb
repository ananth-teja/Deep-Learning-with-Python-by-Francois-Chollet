    "### Text Generation with LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will consider the above problem for sequence generation which can be generalized to any sequence generation problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "***How to generate sequence data?***\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "The general way would be to train an RNN to predict the next token or a few tokens uisng previous tokens as an input. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Token* is a word or a character, and any model which can predict the next token given the previous one is known as *language-model*. A language model captures the *latent-space* of the language: it's statistical nature. \n",
    "- Once we have trained a language model we can sample from it(generate new sequences): you feed it an initial string of text (called conditioning data), and ask it to generate the next token and feed the token again back to the language to model and keep generating text in a loop. \n",
    "- This loop allows us to generate the sequences of arbitiary lengths. \n",
    "- If we feed N characters to an LSTM, and train it to predict the N+1 character. The output of the model will be a softmax over all possible characters: a probablity distribution for the next character. \n",
    "- This is ***Character level neural language model***.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",
    "**Importance of sampling strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "When generating text the way we choose the next character is very important. \n",
    "- One apporach is simple greedy sampling, consisting of always choosing the next most likely character(one with highest probablity). But this would make the system very predictable. \n",
    "- Another interesting approach is to use stochastic sampling i.e. suppose if a probablity of character being the next character is 0.3 then we wil choose the value 30 percent of the time. This would help increase the randomness. This allows even unlikely characters to be sampled some of the time, generating more intersting sentences. But this does not factor in a way to control the randomness of data. We don't want the predictions to be entirely random, i.e. the generated text should be meaningfull. So it is necessary to have a way to control the randomness of the generated text. \n",
    "- In order to control the stochasticity of the random process we will introduce a paramater ***stochastic temperature***. that characterizes the entropy of the probablity distribution used for sampling, it characterizes how surprising or predictable the next character will be. \n",
    "- This is done by processing the original softmax output by using the temperature value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The psuedo code for the same looks like - \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "def reweight_distribution(original_distribution, temperature = 0.5):\n",
    "    distribution = np.log(original_distribution) / temperature\n",
    "    distribution = np.exp(distribution)\n",
    "    return distribution/ np.sum(distribution)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher temperature will result in sampling distributions with higher entropy, and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
